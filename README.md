### Project Description

Our plan is to make a 2D top-down (probably) game where the microcontroller functions as the game controller. The player will tilt the microcontroller and this will translate to inputs on a game running locally on the PC. We will likely just measure the tilt repeatedly at a currently undecided rate so that the player can put the controller down if they want to stop moving. We will make the actual game in python. In the game, the player will move to dodge incoming projectiles that will appear randomly. There will be a timer that keeps track of how long the player can survive until colliding with a projectile.
### Technical Approach

We don’t plan to use any peripherals. We plan to use the accelerometer to measure the board tilt. We also plan to use python externally to write the game.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/lhz3-oe36" then the GitHub page is at "https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/lhz3-oe36" You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
