### Project Description

This project will be a reaction-based game. In it, the LEDs will light up at random intervals. When they light up, the first player to hit their push-button will get a point. Green represents player 1, and red represents player 2. Thus, if player 1 wins, green LED will light up.
### Technical Approach

There will be three buttons used, one for game control (start / reset), and a button for each player. For this project, we will have to use the built-in timer (non-real time).Â
