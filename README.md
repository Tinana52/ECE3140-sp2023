### Project Description

We would like to design a music themed project that the user can play music melody, according to different keys or melodies they played, the users will be able to trigger different fun activities, such as unlocking a door, turning on a fan, turning on or off the light, or playing a cheering sound. The objective of this project is to incorporate music in daily life that can improve the user's aesthetic experience.Â 
### Technical Approach

Arduino board, microphone, keyboard (which doesn't necessarily have to be a keyboard, maybe 7 apples with different sounds), LED, motor, computer, fan. Processing software can play the music upon different signal received, Arduino software, music frequency detection mechanism (such as Shazam).

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/sb875-yj253 then the GitHub page is at https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/sb875-yj253 . You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
