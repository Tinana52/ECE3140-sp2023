### Project Description

Making a violin:

-Use the capacitive touch sensor to "swipe," which would represent the bow/bow strokes

-On a breadboard, have four rows (representing the four strings on the violin) with four buttons each, representing the four fingers you can use to play notes

-Connect this to a computer, which will play the note according to which buttons are pressed and only when there is a swipe & buttons pressed

Â 

*If this is too much, just simplify to 3 buttons potentially, which each can play notes
### Technical Approach

Planning to use the capacitive touch sensor and interrupts --> when a swipe is detected and buttons are pressed, interrupt to play a note

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/tlc234" then the GitHub page is at "https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/tlc234" You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
