### Project Description

Our project idea is space invaders with a bit of a twist. We plan on using the accelerometer on the board, or perhaps a separate sensor, as well as the button to move the ship around and shoot. The goal would be that when we tilt the board, or maybe the other sensor, the ship moves in the direction we shift the board in. Similarly, clicking the button would shoot at the enemies. The game will be played on the computer screen which we will be connected to with a gui implemented in python. The game implementation will be very similar to a regular space invader. 
### Technical Approach

While we are still unsure, we plan on using the accelerometer and the buttons on the board, but we might decide to use another accelerometer device, more console like. The board will also use the computer's screen which it is connected to to output the game. We plan to use python, perhaps pygames, to implement the game interface and C/assembly for input handling. We are also thinking of using a scheduler, with a round robin like implementation so that we can both update the game and receive/deal with the continuous input from the accelerometer.
