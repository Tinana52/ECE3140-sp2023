### Project Description

We want to implement a version of the Pie Face game. Essentially, how this game will work is that there will be two players. The game starts when either switch 1 or switch 3 is pressed, and one player is situated on each switch. On the screen, we will have a GUI that shows the current position of the "pie": if the person pressing switch 1 is pressing it faster, the pie moves to the left, vice versa with switch 3. There is a timer; when the clock runs out, whoever's side the pie is closer to loses and gets "pied in the face." If the pie gets to the threshold of either side before the timer expires, the player on the side without the pie wins. We will have an easy mode and a hard mode; the hard mode unpredictably shifts the pie after a certain amount of time and the timer is longer. 
### Technical Approach

We are not planning on using any other additional peripherals to the board. We are using the switches on the board. In terms of software, we will be using python to create the GUI software, and link it to a C program that polls the switches on the board. We plan to use Tkinter for our GUI for now.
