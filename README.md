### Project Description

We want to design a combination lock using Morse Code. Essentially, the lock will have four digits encoded in Morse Code, and you will need to flash a flashlight for different lengths of time depending on whether you want to encode a dot or dash. We intend to have a dot equate to 1 second of flash and a dash equate to 3 seconds of flash. The lock will have 4 Morse Code digits that you will need to successfully flash in corresponding dots and dashes in order to unlock the lock. In between each digit you flash, you will have to flash the flashlight for 7 seconds in order to set the number you just encoded. For this project, we will make use of the light sensor on the board and figure out how to set up and collect data from the sensor. 
### Technical Approach

We are planning to use the light sensor on the board. We plan on using assembly for the Morse Code digit encodings as in lab 1. Additionally, we plan on using C to set up the light sensor and get the relevant readings from it based on flashlight flashes. We also plan on using PIT channel 0 for timing purposes.
