### Project Description

We would like to do a basic sound recognition project. We would connect a microphone to the board and activate LEDs when sound is detected. Possible extensions of this based on time, complexity, and board capabilities could include displaying discrete volume levels on the board’s LCD display or controlling LED color/frequency based on aspects of the sound detected. 
### Technical Approach

Implementation will require an external microphone and LEDs compatible with the board. Generally, we would poll the microphone for sound data. When detected, we would concurrently output to LEDs while obtaining updated sound information in order to progress.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/ems395-nnb28-sc2484 then the GitHub page is at https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/ems395-nnb28-sc2484 . You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
