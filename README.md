### Project Description

Our final project will try to recreate the retro arcade game Asteroids. The player will be a spaceship that flies in space trying to destroy asteroids that exist in the area that they are flying in. The player is able to shoot bullets from their spaceship to destroy asteroids, and has the ability to turn/accelerate the spaceship. Asteroids have constant velocity and fly in one direction. Destroying an asteroid will add to the player’s score and colliding with an asteroid will cause the player to lose the game.
### Technical Approach

The game logic itself will be implemented in Python. The player’s controls will be implemented using the board in C. Shooting and accelerating the spaceship will most likely be controlled by buttons on the board. The left and right turning could be implemented by using the gyroscope on the board, so that moving the board in certain ways causes the spaceship to turn left and right. We can calculate the angle of the board to make the spaceship turn faster/slower. Having a leveled board means that the ship won’t turn at all.
