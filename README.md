### Project Description

I will be building a set of four traffic lights (calling them 1, 2, 3, 4 for now), which is inspired by the broken traffic lights in front of Duffield. The traffic lights can be demonstrated by a finite state machine, coded by ARM Assembly language. In short, it has 4 states: 1) 1&3 are green and 2&4 are red, 2) 1&3 are yellow and 2&4 are red, 3) 1&3 are red and 2&4 are green, 4) 1&3 are red and 2&4 are yellow. LEDs of the traffic lights will be set using the C program we used in the previous labs. There will be some circuit building with resistor to prevent the LEDs from burning out to quickly.Â 
### Technical Approach

* The board is used as a traffic light controller. It keeps track of the time and handle concurrency between different traffic lights.

* Red, yellow, and green LEDs are used to mimic the traffic light

* Batteries to keep the LEDs alive

* Resistors to prevent LEDs from burning

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/jc3448 then the GitHub page is at https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/jc3448 . You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
