### Project Description

Our final project is a LED memorization game. Essentially, we plan to signify dots and dashes with the green and red LED lights on the board. Then, we will ask a user to press buttons according to what was displayed by the lights, where dots are two clicks and dashes are one click. For example, if the board displays the Green Dot, Red Dash, Green Dot, the user will have to click button 1 once, button 2 twice, button 1 once.
### Technical Approach

We will implement our game through a queue. Once a player starts the game, they will be prompted to memorize one pattern. Then, if they are able to memorize that pattern, they will move onto another pattern which builds on the previous pattern. We plan to create and add patterns to the queue to keep the game going. However, if the player does not enter the correct keystrokes, we will terminate the program. For every round of the game, we will display 3 green lights if they are able to memorize it and if they fail, we will signal 3 red lights to show the program was terminated. We will use no extra peripherals.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/ah868-mw756-vs449" then the GitHub page is at "https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/ah868-mw756-vs449" You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
