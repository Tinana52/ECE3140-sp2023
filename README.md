### Project Description

For our final project, we’re planning to design an electric harmonica on the FRDM-KL46Z board. Using the built-in capacitive touch sensor and an external audio shield module, a user could play a series of notes out loud by maneuvering across the board’s touch sensor. Since the board has a sizable sensor space, it would be fun to attempt full (albeit simpler) songs such as ‘Twinkle, Twinkle’ as the harmonica-based design would only allow for major keys. This set-up could be further expanded into LED output or duets, where the user presses one of the board’s buttons to record a segment which then loops, allowing the user to play a new tune over it. 
### Technical Approach

Focusing on the base level plan of the capacitive touch sensor and the external speaker, our specific technical approach in terms of peripherals, software, and processes is in several steps. Hardware must be decided upon up front, as the purchasing lead times dictate testing and hardware testing. While there are ways of connecting the board’s outputted audio to the laptop, which will be helpful for initial testing, it’s important to decide on and order the speaker as soon as possible. The software system can then be set up and programmed eg. downloading the necessary drivers and packages for supporting the slider and audio conversion. Once the set-up is built, the actual program can be designed and programmed for further testing and debugging. This step will likely take up the majority of time, as personal projects can run into issues with minimal information or unexpected behavior. Therefore, our team will budget a significant amount of the time left to do so. Once the final project is working as expected, all that’s left is to finalize the web page (which will be updated throughout the process for progress checks/collection) and the corresponding video and write-up.
