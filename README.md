### Project Description

I think almost everyone have played the classic game Fruit Slide. In this game, our goal is to silde as many fruits as possible. The fruits are fallen from the top and we cut them by slidng on the screen. Motivated by this game, we plan to reproduce this game using FRDM-KL46Z board. The main part will be same as the normal game, but we want to change the input of sliding on the screen into our board's wave path.
### Technical Approach

Instead of sliding on a screen like the normal game does, we will wave the board as an operating handle to cut the fruits. There are mainly two parts of this project. First, we need to implement the Fruit Slide game and switch the input with our board. Second, as we are waving the board, the gyroscope and accelerometer on the board will keep track of the direction and acceleration. Therefore, we can calculate this wave path and display it on the computer screen to serve as the knife. After these two parts are done, we can combine them, test it and debug it.
