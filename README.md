### Project Description

We don't have a clear idea yet. Some ideas we came up are: the use of buttons to regulate the intensity of light recreating a light system used in performances or similar, recreating a rudimentary megaphone connecting the board to a speaker output, coding a game from which will show up on the computer (but we are not sure if this would be feasible) to control using the touch pad on the board.
### Technical Approach

In general we would use the board and explore to what extent it can be connected to the computer: pop up windows, take data and output back to it, etc. We don't know if we may need external peripherals yet.
