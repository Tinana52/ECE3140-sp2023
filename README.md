### Project Description

We are creating a mock satellite, including features such as gyroscope sensors, a light sensor, and an accelerometer. From the light sensor we will know which way we want to realign the satellite, as we are going to want to simulate the satellite turning toward the earth to take a "picture" of it. Additionally we can have things externally such as wifi to mock the idea of a ground station to communicate with our satellite. We will use the LEDs on the board to simulate the X, Y and Z axes "thrusting" to counter the thrust that the gyroscope sensor is feeling to align the satellite. The brightness of the LED may correlate to the intensity of the thrust needed.
### Technical Approach

We are planning to use concurrency since we are using multiple sensors and constant reading data. We are planning to use UART protocol communication between the board and the sensors.
