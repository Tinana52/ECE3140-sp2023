### Project Description

We currently plan on creating a car game, where the game generates a random set of obstacles in the car's path, as shown below. The user then tilts the board to move around the screen, and the game ends when the car hits an obstacle. The game keeps track of your score based on the amount of time you're alive, and it increases every second; this can be displayed on the board itself, as well as having LED indicators when you've lost or set a new high score.

### Technical Approach

We plan on using the accelerometer to tilt the board to dictate movement (left, right, forward, back). We also could use the button for special power-ups. Also, we could use the LED display to display the updating score, and flash the LED lights when you start / level up / die. 

Software-wise, we plan on using a computer as the GUI (UART?).
