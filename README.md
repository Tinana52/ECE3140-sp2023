### Project Description

We would like to make a functioning LED alarm clock. The input to the alarm clock would be a series of morse code digits representing the amount of time for the clock in seconds. Using two different buttons, one to represent dashes and the other dots, we can have an interactive input for the alarm clock. Once the elapsed time has passed for the clock it can trigger one of the LEDs to flash until the alarm clock is either turned off or snoozed. Later in the project, if we have the time we can add a display for the time set using the LCD display. In addition, we may add a snoozing feature by shaking the board (detected by the accelerometer). Once snoozed, the alarm clock will reset with the previously set time.
### Technical Approach

We will only be using the board provided by the course, however, we will be using more components on the board that we typically did not use during the labs. These components include the two other buttons (SW1 and SW3) as well as SW2 which we used in the labs. Furthermore will use the accelerometer on the board and look into showing values on the board’s display. We will also continue to use both the red and green LED. 

For software we will continue to use MCUXpressoIDE, included in our code will be a real-time clock that will allow us to time when the alarm is triggered. We will also create a system to read morse code imputed by the buttons so that we can take in inputs from the user.

## Feedback.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/ala76-ary25" then the GitHub page is at "https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/ala76-ary25" You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
