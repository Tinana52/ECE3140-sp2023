### Project Description

Our final project shall create an interactive game console for space invaders. We plan to interface our board with a python script running a space invaders game. We plan to interface the development board with the laptop using a UART connection. To move the spacecraft left and right, we plan to use feedback from the accelerometer. To fire, we plan to use the buttons. To indicate the number of levels won, or if the game is over, we plan to use the segment LCD. Additionally, we will indicate if you have won a level and a countdown to the level beginning using the LEDs. To close the game, the user will be able to cover the LED light sensor for 15 seconds.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/ljg227-pd337 then the GitHub page is at https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/ljg227-pd337 . You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
