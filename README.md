### Project Description

We aim to design a heart monitor using a pulse sensor that flashes the LED based on the heart rate.

Â 
### Technical Approach

We will use a fingertip pulse sensor and the KL46Z to build the heart rate monitor. Also, we will build off our implementation from lab 2 when flashing the LEDs. The pulse sensor requires one analog pin, so we will use one of the KL46Z analog pins (PTB0 -PTC1).
