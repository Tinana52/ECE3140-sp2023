### Project Description

Our current idea is a fitness tracker that utilizes the board’s accelerometer to record physical activity and provide data on the user's activity levels. We would use the accelerometer on the board to calculate the distance traveled by the user. With this we can provide estimates for the number of calories burned and the number of steps taken. 
### Technical Approach

We plan on using the accelerometer and potentially the gyroscope. In terms of software features, we will probably make user of a PIT timer.
