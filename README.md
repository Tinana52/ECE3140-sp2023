### Project Description

We are going to replicate the two-player game called shadowboxing which involves one player choosing a direction with their hands (in this case the board) and the other trying to not choose the same direction (with the arrow keys) that the other player chooses.
### Technical Approach

We will utilize the board's accelerometer to have the first player input the directions the second player wants to avoid and one of the switches to start the input sequence for the game. We will utilize a Python GUI and a Python script to show the second player the directions once the game starts and to record the second player's inputs.
