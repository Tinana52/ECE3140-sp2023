### Project Description

Our project will be using the FRDM-KL46Z to create a musical instrument similar to a stylophone. We plan on using the touch slider to play notes of different pitches and duration while outputting the notes in real-time from our laptop speakers. Users can interact with our project by having the board connected to a computer and pressing/holding their finger on the touch slider. Depending on where they touch the touch slider or the capacitance, different pitches will be output based on a predetermined range. A shorter or longer note will be output depending on how long the user is touching the touch slider. A quick press is a shorter note, while hold is a longer note.

If we have time we plan on incorporating the LCD to display the name of the note that is being played at the moment. In addition, if we still have time we plan on incorporating a recording/playback component to our musical instrument. The user will still be able to play notes in real-time using the touch slider but if they would like to record what they are playing they can press one I/O button to start/stop recording and the other I/O button to playback the recording. The recording will be signaled by turning on the red LED. While recording, the user can still hear the notes they are playing in real-time and they can press the same I/O button to stop recording, causing the red LED to turn off. Users will press the second I/O button to playback the notes they just recorded. If something has been recorded then the green LED will be on to signify that we have something to playback.
### Technical Approach

We are planning to use the touch slider to control the pitch of the note and how long the note is sustained. If we have time, we plan on using the LCD to display the note and pitch that we are playing back and use the I/O buttons for recording and playing back sound. For example, one button would be designated to start/stop the recording and the other would be for playing back the recording.  

For the board, we are using the touch sensor library and figuring out how to match different pitches to specific locations or capacitance on the touch slider. We also plan on using concurrency so that we can handle the different inputs and outputs that we want our board to produce. Since we want the user to be able to hear the note that they made on the touch slider, we plan to use concurrency so that once the user touches the touch sensor, we will be able to quickly process the input and be able to output the sound on the computer almost instantly for the user to hear the note he or she produced. In addition to letting the user generate different notes by pressing the touch slider, we would hardcode a default range of notes (i.e one octave) that correspond to different capacitance readings or locations on the touch slider so that we can limit the number of notes that our musical instrument can play. 

To playback the sound, we would use the beep function in C which already has a list of frequencies correlating to the different pitches that a beep could make and the beep function already controls the duration a note is sustained. Then, we could use that to generate different notes and be able to more directly play the sound back in C. In order to account for the different durations of time that a note could be held, we would create a while loop in C where, depending on how long the user pressed the touch slider, that would determine how long the code would stay in the while loop. 

If we have time, we would use the LCD to display the note that the user was playing by using the LCD library and figuring out how to concurrently play the note the user inputted and display the specific note that was played. Specifically, in our implementation of the LCD library, we would use the LCD library to figure out how to display the different letters and numbers.

Also, if we have time, we would use concurrency for the I/O pins by designating one button for start/stop recording. The red LED will turn on signifying that the recording is now in process, and also the program will record the notes made by the user. When the user presses stop, we turn off the red LED signifying that the recording stopped and we let the program know that the recording should end. Then, the green LED would turn on to signify that something has been recorded. The other button would be used for playing back the recording.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/bl478-kaf245-zl348 then the GitHub page is at https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/bl478-kaf245-zl348 . You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
