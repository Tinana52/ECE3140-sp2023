### Project Description

We are going to implement a music game with some sensors and the board (similar to Taiko no Tatsujin or Piano tiles). The player would look at the “notes” they need to play next and touch the two “buttons” or move their hands towards or away from the distance sensor at the right time to match the beat/melody. These actions would generate the corresponding sound effects. The game UI would be on the computer and the data from the sensors would be read and the UI would be updated.
### Technical Approach

We are planning to use the touch bar on the chip for the drums and we ordered a proximity sensor with detection range around 2-400cm with standard I/O output (link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SC1YJ21?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) for the theremin component. We will collect analog touch and distance data from the sensors, convert it to digital/numerical data, and pass that information to the python backend via usb so further calculations on whether the players clicked a certain button (or played a certain pitch) at the right time can be done.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/yy389-zy278 then the GitHub page is at https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/yy389-zy278 . You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
