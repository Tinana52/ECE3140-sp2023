### Project Description

We plan on creating a version of the popular game 2048. We will be using the capacitive touch slider in order to record how the tiles move. Additionally, we will be displaying the score on the 7-segment display on the board. We will also incorporate reset buttons to restart the game. The game board will be printed onto the console of the computer which will run the game.
### Technical Approach

The touch capacitive sensor will be used for input purposes, as described above.
