### Project Description

We aim to create a reimagined version of the game Doodle Jump. Players can control the character by tilting the board and possibly using a touch sensor.Â 
### Technical Approach

Players will be able to control the jumping direction by tilting the FRDM board to the left or right. We will use an accelerometer to measure the movement, we will also need to fine-tune this feature to implement thresholds for the best gameplay. The FRDM board will contain and update all game logic and communicates with any connected computer via UART. A simple GUI program will run on the computer to facilitate gameplay, to achieve this we plan to use either a Java or Python program. Also as a reach goal, we may implement shooting enemies using the touch sensor. We will be implementing interrupts to simulate an update loop. Also if we are able to implement the touch sensor we will also be implementing concurrency.
