### Project Description

For our project we want to create a sound volume guessing game. A display will show a certain number of decibels and the user will use their voice to match that number. The sound intensity of the user's voice will be detected by a sound sensor module. Once the user reaches the correct volume with their voice, the LED on the board will light up and the game will move on to the next level. If we have time, we will also record how much time it takes the user to guess the correct volume, use that to then calculate the score and show it on the display.
### Technical Approach

We will use a 4 digit 7-segment display, a sound sensor module, and maybe an arduino. We will use the software we used the whole semester.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/ms2663-rcf82 then the GitHub page is at https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/ms2663-rcf82 . You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
