### Project Description

We will be making the snake game using C code and the board. We will use the two white buttons on the top left and top right of the board to control the direction the snake is moving, and use the larger black button on the bottom as a reset button so that the game can be played multiple times. We will represent the game board of the snake using a 2D array. We use a UART to display the game on the computer screen.
### Technical Approach

To avoid unnecessary complications we will not use any external hardware peripherals, and we will strive to limit the usage of extra libraries. Since the board will be connected to the computer we will not need an external power source.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/cfb96-kbh64-kmm522 then the GitHub page is at https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/cfb96-kbh64-kmm522 . You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
