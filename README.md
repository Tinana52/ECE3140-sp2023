### Project Description

We are creating a mini AI on the board, much like a toy a child may have except without the noise. Using peripherals, such as the accelerator, buttons, and light sensor, doing certain actions will cause the display available on the board to display ‘reactions’ that the board will have those events and may also use the LEDs to respond to those actions as well.
### Technical Approach

We plan to use the segment LCD, light sensor, switches, capacitive touch sensor, and LEDS to implement this project. We most likely will timer interrupts and polling to look for ‘events’ to occur by checking the input of the peripherals and then outputting to the other ones to show the reactions. We have outlined ways to make numbers of the display as it is a 7-segment display and thus needs to be manipulated to get certain letters. As it can only display 4 7-segments at once, we plan to have the board react through simple, caveman like responses.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/aw676-sal267 then the GitHub page is at https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/aw676-sal267 . You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
