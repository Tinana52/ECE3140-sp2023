### Project Description

We are planning to create a Breakout game using the board as a controller. The game would feature a ball bouncing between bricks and a paddle controlled by the player. Basic features of a game such as scores, timing, player continues should be included. Depending on the rate at which we develop the project, other features could be added.Â 
### Technical Approach

Since the FRDM-KL46Z board has buttons and other input devices, we need only the board connected with a computer and no other peripherals. We'll use Python or Java(if possible) to handle the game graphics while code related to the board are handled with C. The visual aspects of the game requires graphics functions of the used programming language, and in order to handle user input with the board, GPIO code is also needed.
