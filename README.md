### Project Description

We plan to use the SPI or IIC communication methods to send data and hopefully commands between 2 boards. Expected commands that a receiving board should be able to execute are turning on LEDs or keeping track of some state to be decided later.
### Technical Approach

We are going to be using the SPI, IIC, or UART communication methods as discussed in lecture; which one in particular we plan to use will be decided later. We also expect to use LEDs at length like we have been for the other labs.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/jk2327-kmz25-sa685 then the GitHub page is at https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/jk2327-kmz25-sa685 . You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
