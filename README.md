### Project Description

It will be a game that uses the board's LEDs and gyroscope. The user will hold the board however they want and then click a button to begin the game. The goal of the game is to find the orientation the board wants to be in. When the game begins, the board will pick a random orientation it wants. The user will rotate the board, as they do this, the red LED will be blinking. It will blink faster as the user gets closer to the correct orientation. Once the user is within an acceptable range, the green LED will turn on and the user will click a button to conclude the game. 
### Technical Approach

We do not plan to use any peripherals. We plan to use the LEDs, the accelerometer to serve as a gyroscope, and the buttons on the board.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/ap736-der242-emw236" then the GitHub page is at "https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/ap736-der242-emw236" You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
