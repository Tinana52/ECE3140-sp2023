### Project Description

Our final project would be a minesweeper game. The user is able to move around, open a cell, and add/remove a flag by clicking the keyboard. Mines scattered throughout a board are divided into cells and shown on a display. When the user wins the game, the Green LED on the FRDM-KL46Z board would light up. If the user clicks on a bomb, the Red LED would light up and the game ends.
### Technical Approach

* Peripheral devices:

* A keyboard with 6 buttons: 4 buttons to move the position (up, down, left, and right), 1 button to add/remove a flag, and 1 button to open a cell.

* A display to show the game.

* Software features:

* Memory layout: save the states of all the cells in the heap space. The value saved should be an array of three values: a number to show the number of mines hidden in the surrounding area, a character to show whether a Flag is added to the cell by the user, and another character to show whether the cell is displayed or not.

* A function that presents the grid on the display 

* A function that randomly sets the layout of the mine

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/lh494-ql268" then the GitHub page is at "https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/lh494-ql268" You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
