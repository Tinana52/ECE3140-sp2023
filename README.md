### Project Description

As of now, we're not quite sure yet but for now, what we thought was to create a reactive time stimulator/game using the buttons on the board. For example, I click the button as quick as possible if the red blinks and my enemy clicks as possible if green blinks and we will see who won based on the points for each person. 
### Technical Approach

We are not using any peripherals (additional hardware). We are just using the board as our hardware and the software will just be used in MCUEXPRESSO to write our code.
