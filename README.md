### Project Description

We are aiming to make a Mario Kart Game that is linked to a python script and uses the accelerometer on the board to make Mario jump up and down. Mario will have a “fight” against Bowser where Bowser shoots fire balls and Mario has to avoid them by going up and down the screen. The way of going up and down will be moving the board
### Technical Approach

The Mario game will be coded in Python and we will program the connection between the Python code and the board program in MCUXpresso. We will be using a communication protocol to be able to interface the accelerometer outputs of the board with the python script. We will also use one of the switch buttons on the board to stop/play the game using interrupts. We also want to use the LED and LCD display to give messages to the user: green LED when they win and a message with “Congratulations” for example.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/cv252-rm722-rm857 then the GitHub page is at https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/cv252-rm722-rm857 . You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
