### Project Description

For our project, we would like to create a game.

 

The game would consist of the the player guessing the Morse Code displayed in the beginning of the game. The player would have 3 tries of guessing the Morse Code. The Morse Code would most likely be a digit between 0 to 9. 
### Technical Approach

We will be mainly using the Red LED, Green LED and the two user input buttons, 4 digit segment LCD Segment.

The Green LED will be used to display the Morse Code in the beginning of the game. The Red LED will be used to indicate that you have failed to guessing the Morse Code. One of the input button will be used to guess the Morse Code by pressing the input button by the number you are guessing. The other input button will be used when you are finished inputing your guess. The LCD segment will be used to display the number of tries you have left.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/jj733-ofa2" then the GitHub page is at "https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/jj733-ofa2" You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
