### Project Description

We will design a morse code reader which takes input from one of the on-board switches, and outputs the string data to an external computer, where it is stored in a text file. 
### Technical Approach

Connecting to a personal computer (as a display) using the board's serial port.

We will use the segment display to display the most recent letter.

We will use the on-board switches as inputs into our program. 

 

Software Features:

Concurrency: taking in input data, and processing input data will be done separately.

Data I/O: streaming text to an external computer, and storing it in a file.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/bpc72-san72" then the GitHub page is at "https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/bpc72-san72" You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
