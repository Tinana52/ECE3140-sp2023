### Project Description

We plan to use the FRDM KL46Z development board to create a metronome, which is a time-keeping device used by musicians to help them practice playing music in time. The main function of a metronome is to output some signal at regular time intervals, either a sound or a flash of some sort. We will use the user LEDs on the board to flash at regular time intervals. The user will have two different ways of selecting a tempo at which they would like the LEDs to flash. We will use the LCD display on the board to show the tempo which is currently being flashed in beats per minute. The user will be able to either use the capacitive touch slider to move the tempo up or down, or they will be able to tap a tempo using one of the buttons SW1 or SW3 (tapping a tempo will mean pressing the button several times at the speed they want the metronome to flash). They can use these controls to choose a specific tempo within a range that we set, and then the LEDs will immediately begin flashing at that tempo. We plan to also use one of the buttons as a way of switching between the modes of tempo tapping and using the touch slider. 

Beyond this basic design, we have some ideas for additional functionality which we may add.  For example, given that we have two LEDs at our disposal, it would be useful to the user if one of the LEDs flashed every beat, and the other LED flashed only on the downbeat of every measure (once every n beats). This would mean we would have to also add in a way for the user to change the time signature so that the downbeats flash at the correct times. Moreover, it may be useful for the user to save certain tempos as presets. We also may include music files that could be played by the computer, and the tempo of those songs would be matched by our metronome so that they play in sync with each other. However, the number of features we can add will most likely ultimately be limited by the few ways there are of providing input to the board with no external peripherals.
### Technical Approach

In order for the LED to toggle exactly at regular time intervals, we will be repeatedly using the PIT timer to trigger interrupts at the time interval selected by the user. One of the technical challenges of the project will most likely be receiving input from the touch slider, since we have not used that yet in class. We will have to receive input from the slider and modify the tempo accordingly, and we will need to find the right sensitivity for how much the tempo should change based on the movement of the user’s finger on the slider. We will have to write several interrupt handlers so that all the different versions of user input can be responded to appropriately. Additionally, we will have to figure out how to display digits on the LCD display and change them quickly in response to user input. It will probably make the implementation process easier if we use a finite state machine, which will most likely be reflected by our code. We are not intending to use any peripherals.
