### Project Description

We are building a game of Connect-4 controlled by the buttons and slider of the board. We can use the slider to choose which column to drop the coin into, and then we press the button to drop the coin. We can also use the accelerometer to detect shaking of the board to trigger a message if you want to reset the game.
### Technical Approach

We will use the slider, the buttons, and the accelerometer. We will build the game using C and Python. We will run the game on a computer and connect the embedded board to the computer via USB serial.
