## Your Project Answers

### Project Description

We plan to create a game based off the toy Bop-it. We can write code to display different commands to the user such as press button x, touch the sensor, step forwards, step backwards, step left, and step right. The more commands a user executes successfully the faster the commands will come. When they mess one up the game ends.
### Technical Approach

We plan to use almost all the peripherals on the board. We want to use the compass, gyroscope, buttons, and the capacitive touch slider. As far as software features we don't need any major ones. The coding part will not be too complicated because all we need to do is display commands and continue to provide new ones within the game logic.
