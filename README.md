### Project Description

For our project we are intending to create a harmonica device through use of our computer's speakers and the capacitive touch slider. When sliding the touch slider to the left it will produce a sound lower in frequency in the octave, and when slid to the right higher up in the octave. The two buttons on either side of the slider will then be used to change which instrument is being played. The 4 digit display will be used to show which frequency is being played.
### Technical Approach

Peripherals that we intend to use is a speaker. And we may use a python script to generate the sound. We would also use an external library to generate noises from different instruments. We will transmit data to the computer which will then generate the required instrument noise, which will then send it back to the board to use its DAC to then drive a speaker.

We will also try to load a sound font onto the board to play everything from the board itself. Sounds will probably be limited to 8-bit sounds, but it would then be all contained on the board. We could even get a sound chip to make the sounds on.
