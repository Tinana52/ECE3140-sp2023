### Project Description

We plan to program a Brickbreaker game using the board’s built-in capacitive touch slider acting as the player input. The input controls an on-screen paddle used to play the classic game Brickbreaker. In order to do this, we will need to send the data from the sensor to the computer. Then on the computer, we will process that data to move the on-screen paddle, using the graphics of said computer. 

Once the player’s input is received by the computer from the board, it will be used to play the game. During this time, the board will also receive feedback from the computer, and respond promptly. For example, the board may light up an LED when the player completes a level or breaks a block. 
### Technical Approach

We are planning to use the built-in capacitive touch slider and interface with the computer as a peripheral device that will run the game and process the data from the center. For software features, we are planning to use available video game programming libraries to help us with the graphics and user interface.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/ayz27-cys37" then the GitHub page is at "https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/ayz27-cys37" You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
