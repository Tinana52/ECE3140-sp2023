### Project Description

We will be implementing a smart thermostat which controls the temperature of a room based on the ambient room temperature.
### Technical Approach

We plan to create a controlled environment, and alter the temperature below and above certain thresholds to demonstrate the functioning of smart thermostat. We may use peripherals such as a fan, thermometer, heating and cooling unit. We will be programming in C++ or python, and will use a notification alert system, and a temperature input system.
