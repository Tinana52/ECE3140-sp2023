### Project Description

We would like to build an embedded plant monitoring system. Based on humidity and temperature levels of a plant's ecosystem, we can adjust the temperature of a light shining on the plant and automatically water the plant. 
### Technical Approach

We are planning on using a moisture monitor, a water pump, a temperature monitor, and perhaps some sort of articial light. Using the moisture monitor, we can create a script that determines whether the moisture is above or below a specific threshold, and based on that information, we will be able to adjust the amount of water being pumped into the system using the water pump. We will do the same in terms of the temperature peripherals.
