### Project Description

We got our inspiration from the Otamatone which is a toy musical synthesizer. We knew that the board had a capacitive touch slider and we wanted to connect it to the computer speaker to play music and sound. We will also have three buttons for the user to choose the frequency range: tenor, alto, and soprano. The user can use the touch slider to slide and play music, similar to the working principle of the Otamatone.
### Technical Approach

Peripheral: PIT(to read continuous input from slider), Interrrupt(for switching frequency range when the user is playing and pressing a button), Lock (to prevent the user from pressing two buttons together)

Software Feature: We plan to finish the hardware synthesizer first because it's a toy synthesizer so the user experience largely depends on the hardware, and software is a lower priority. We might make a GUI display the note the user is playing based on the frequency detected.
