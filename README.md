### Project Description

I want to make a LED strip sign. The lights will display binary numbers and allow users to type messages and display them. 
### Technical Approach

I will be using a strip of led lights, each individual light will represent one binary digit, and different colours will be chosen for ones and zeros. I will also be using a keypad to allow users to input messages. I will be using the adafruit dotstar led strips. I will be utilising a python module to help control the LEDs however the majority of my code will be c. I plan to use polling to track when a key is pressed and then use scheduling to add the number to the queue to be displayed. Depending on how much progress I am able to make I hope to be able to make the sign more customisable by giving the user the option to change colours, choose the duration that the message is displayed, and I have access to a few sensors that I would like to take advantage of.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/bb584 then the GitHub page is at https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/bb584 . You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
