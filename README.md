### Project Description

We plan to implement a version of the Flappy Bird game by incorporating additional functionalities and features. By default, the bird would fly in trajectory and we have to press the button to control the bird to fly up. The bird has to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them, and the player would get higher scores by passing through more obstacles. We will include difficulty levels for users to choose (easy/difficult) by pressing one of the white buttons, and we will have the other button available for users to press to control the bird to fly up. We will also display the score to the users.Â 
### Technical Approach

In general, we plan to use the board to control the movement of a bird. We are planning to use the two white buttons (sw1 and sw3) and the 4-digit segment LCD on the board. The left white button (sw1) could control the bird to move up, and the right white button could change the difficulty of the game ranging from 1(easy mode) to 2 (hard mode). The LCD would display the current score of the player. When the bird hits the column of green pipes or ground, the red LED will be on (the user loses the game). If the bird successfully flies between a pair of green pipes without hitting them, the green LED will blink fast and the digit in LCD will increment by 1.

## Feedback.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/hl793-xl828-yf233 then the GitHub page is at https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/hl793-xl828-yf233 . You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
