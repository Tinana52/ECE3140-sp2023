### Project Description

We will implement a flashlight morse code decoder. After the user shines a flashlight toward the light sensor of the board, in the pattern of morse code, the board will convert it into corresponding numbers or English. The user can press a button, such as SW1, to end the input, and the board will send the translated string to a text terminal on a laptop, where it will be displayed.
### Technical Approach

We will be using the light sensor on the board to detect the flashlight input. We will also be using a text terminal, like PuTTY, to display the output and UART to set up the communication between the board and the laptop terminal.

In order to incorporate what we have learned in class, we will be using concurrency to simultaneously detect flashlight input while processing the data to English to display on the LCD screen. This in turn will enhance the responsiveness and efficiency of our project.
