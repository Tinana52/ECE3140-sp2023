### Project Description

We plan to do a two player game where when the lights turn on the first player to push the button either gains a point or loses a point based upon the LED color that lights up. Then the screen will change colors to represent the player who hit their button first. Player with the most points wins.
### Technical Approach

We are planning to use the LEDs but on top of that also use the two buttons to track player interaction and use the screen to give feedback to the user.
