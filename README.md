### Project Description

The project is a simple traffic light system that uses an Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (HC-SR04) and a NXP FRDM-KL46Z board, along with two different color LEDs (one red and one green). The device will simulate the behavior of a traffic light, changing between red and green states depending on the presence of an object within a certain distance range.
### Technical Approach

To build this device, we will use an Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (HC-SR04) and a NXP FRDM-KL46Z board, along with two LEDs (one red and one green). We will program the microcontroller on the board to read the sensor input and activate the LEDs to simulate a traffic light.

In the program, we will set a distance threshold, and when the distance measured by the sensor falls within that threshold, the traffic light will switch from red to green. After a certain time interval, the traffic light will switch back to red, regardless of whether there is still an object within range. Overall, this project will involve programming and circuit design skills.
