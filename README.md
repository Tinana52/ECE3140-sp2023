## Your Project Answers

### Project Description

We would like to create a Morse Code Detector similar to the one proposed on Tuesday's lectures with some extra features. Something we would like to add is two way decoder: from letters to Morse Code and from Morse Code to letters. Another feature is to have it support binary code as well as being able to create it's own code for those in need of a reliable form of encryption.Â 
### Technical Approach

Since this project can be implemented with just the breadboard, we do not need any other peripherals, perhaps a flashlight and obviously a computer. In terms of software, we haven't decided what features we are planning to use, but we'll deinitely have at least an input and ouput option for users to code in.
