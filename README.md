### Project Description

A crucial part of engineering is distance. Distance is involved in velocity, energy, and many other topics within the discipline. The idea is to create an embedded system that allows a user to gauge distance. The device will use a distance sensor to gauge how far away an object in front of it is. This device will peripherally include a light that will be dim or bright depending on the distance the object is from the system and an audio device that can play at a higher pitch when objects are close and a lower pitch when they are far away. This provides a visual component to verify with ease how close the object is to a user who is standing far away. For the user who wants to be near the device while using it, it will be able to give readings of distance on a computer hooked up to the device.
### Technical Approach

From a software perspective, in order to achieve a reading of distance and a correct level of light, the device will use concurrency and locks to make sure that the distance is only changed in one process at a time. This embedded system can be used for distance measuring for scientific purposes, for architecture, and for finding lost objects as well. There will be a process for calculating the distance, one for determining what sound should be made, one for determining light brightness, one to handle reading to a user computer, and a main process to organize all processes correctly. The technical approach is essentially to make every feature a separate process, giving the user a device that best suits their wants and needs.
