### Project Description

I want to implement a game of Simon, where a sequence of different colored LEDs flash and the user needs to push buttons corresponding to each LED in the correct order to recreate the pattern. If the user succeeds, he levels up and the next pattern is slightly longer. If he fails, the game is over. 
### Technical Approach

I plan on using external LEDs to increase the range of colors I can use as well as 4 external pushbuttons. These will be connected to the board via GPIO pins. Pressing a button will trigger an interrupt that will move the game into the next state, whether that is a game over for a wrong button press or waiting for the next correct button press.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/lsg84 then the GitHub page is at https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/lsg84 . You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
