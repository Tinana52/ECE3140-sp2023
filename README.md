### Project Description

We want to create a timed artificial light for greenhouse plants. Plants in the greenhouse need a certain amount of sunlight each day, and we want to balance making sure the plant gets enough light, but not wasting energy on artificial lighting if it is not necessary.  If a plant does not receive enough sunlight during the day (< 6 hours during the day) based on visible light sensor data, then we would calculate the amount of time needed at night to have the artificial light to be turned on. Else, if the plant does get enough sun light during the day based on the data from the sensor, then we would not turn on the artificial light at night. It is critical to have the amount of sunlight calculated at night, rather than have the light turn on when the sensor detects no sunlight, because weather is variable and we won't know how much sunlight it will get later in the day. 
### Technical Approach

We will use a realtime scheduling for the artificial light timer, which will be calculated by figuring how many additional hours of time are needed to have the artificial light turned on for at night. We will use nonrealtime to determine if the artificial light needs to be turned on or not based on the logic stated in our high level description. For peripherals, we will make use of the visible light sensor on the board and the built in clock, as well as an artificial light that will be attached to the board. For software, we will use the libraries and functions from class (such as a modified version of the real time scheduler from lab 5), library for the visible light sensor and sensor data, and to create a library for the artificial light (similar to the LED library we created in lab 2).

## Feedback.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/map398-sk2329" then the GitHub page is at "https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/map398-sk2329" You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
