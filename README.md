### Project Description

We are planning on designing an Atari Breakout-inspired game that would utilize the accelerometer of one board as the "controller." The game would involve trying to keep a ball above the ground and use it to destroy a wall of blocks.
### Technical Approach

We would utilize the accelerometer on the board as the controller, and enable communication between the board and the screen through concurrency programming via C. There would be multithread programming as well to prioritize different stage states. Finally, we would need to become proficient in Python GUI libraries for the screen.
