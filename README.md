*

What our project is going to do is to let two players use two buttons to play this game through the board.
### Technical Approach

Technical Approach
------------------

*

We need to use two buttons to receive input from players.

*

We need to use UART to transfer data from buttons to the computer.

*

In the computer, there will be a python program receiving data from the board.

*

There will also be a pygame module in the python code to display the game on the screen of the computer.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/rh539-xs77 then the GitHub page is at https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/rh539-xs77 . You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
