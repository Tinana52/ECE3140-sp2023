### Project Description

We plan on making an electronic deadbolt lock with a keypad. We will 3D print the body of the lock and the deadbolt, order a keypad, a motor, and some gears, and use the board as the brain of the lock. We will write the code to transfer to the lock, and be able to use a battery pack to power it. We could use an ultrasonic sensor to activate the lock. Then from there, be able to input a code, that when correct unlocks the lock and flashes green led lights. Otherwise, it will flash red led lights. We can implement sequences of certain key presses to create passcodes, delete passcodes, and possible additional keypad functionality.
### Technical Approach

As stated above, our hardware will consist of our board, a keypad, a motor with gears, and a 3D printed body. In terms of our software, we will have to implement logic to read the inputs and perform tasks depending on the input received. We can make use of scheduling deadlines to perform a reset if an input is not received within a certain time limit.
