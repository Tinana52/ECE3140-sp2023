### Project Description

I will be designing an interactive reaction game using the board to control the game that will be displayed on the computer screen. My game will have a main screen where circles (or some other shape) of two colors will appear with random frequencies. The player will be expected to react to these appearances of shapes through the board, and according to their reaction time, they will be collecting points. I am planning to use two (or more) buttons to be able to press and be an indicator of the player’s reaction to a certain color. This will be a one-player game, but other features like a scoreboard can be implemented to enable multiple players.
### Technical Approach

I am planning to use two (or more) buttons to be able to press and be an indicator of the player’s reaction to a certain color. Since there might be events like multiple presses to a button, resource conflicts might occur. For this reason, I am planning to implement locks, possibly taking the implementation from the previous labs. Also, I will be using interrupts to be able to interrupt the process that will be waiting on an input (from the button channel). I am not entirely sure about how the front end of the game and the board will interact, so I cannot predict the other software features I will be using.
