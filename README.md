## Your Project Answers

### Project Description

Our project will be a memory-based game using the accelerometer as well as external peripheral buttons to require the user to input a randomly generated and increasingly long rhythm in each round. The rhythm will be given to the user prior to each round using the LEDs to correspond to one of two buttons or a rapid upward movement of the board. The rhythm must be re-inputted back in close rhythm as it was given and the PIT will interrupt if the user hesitates to input the correct next input. 
### Technical Approach

We will randomly generate a rhythm for each round where the length is the previous round plus one. This will be represented as a list of random integers from 1 to 3 corresponding to the three different actions, the two buttons, and the accelerometer. Once the list is generated, it will be recited back to the user. While it is being played, each action adds a process to a linked list. That process will listen for the correct input corresponding with the current output of the board. When the user has the full rhythm, it will take processes off the linked list one by one to make sure it is being given the same rhythm in response. The periodic interval timer resets after each input, giving the user a fixed amount of time to think of the next correct input. With each round, we give a decreasing amount of "hesitation time" to the PIT to have the game increase in difficulty by length and time.

## Feedback.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/hag65-srg293 then the GitHub page is at https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/hag65-srg293 . You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
