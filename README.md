### Project Description

We plan to work on the tide clock project. In general, this project aims to create a clock that displays real-time tidal information using LED lights (we may use Adafruit NeoPixel Sticks). The basic functionality of the project is that it will look like a light stick, and when the tide goes up and down, the LED stick will also follow the tide up and down with the flow. We will implement the coding part of the system on the FRDM46Z microcontroller board given to us in this class. In the coding part we will use the program to calculate and update tidal information in real time. The Tideclock incorporates pre-programmed data on tidal movements for specific locations, as well as real-time data from a network of tide gauges. The pre-programmed data may be used as a baseline for Tideclock's calculations. This allows for an accurate representation of the current tidal state. In addition to the pre-programmed data, we also rely on real-time data to adjust the LED display and provide a more accurate representation of the current tidal state. Overall, the Tideclock is an excellent tool for anyone interested in tracking the tides, whether for recreational or professional purposes and is a feasible and also fun final project.
### Technical Approach

We plan to use LED strips, Adafruit NeoPixel Sticks. We may add more as the project goes on.

As for software features, we may use existing API to obtain data related to the tide, e.g. tidal heights predictions at any location of the world ocean and at any time. We will process the data and pick locations with more extreme trends. Since the LED doesn't simply vary uniformly between High and Low tide, we might set up an internal clock and wifi connection of the board to obtain real-time data. With the LED strips, only a sinusoidal pattern could be displayed., but on the final project website, we could build a more complex clock simulation with suggestions for suitable activities at given tidal levels. We may also include localization configuration that allows the users to configure the location for which they want to display the tide information. In addition, hardware integration must be implemented to ensure that our code on board can control the LED correctly. Also, we may have error handling and exception handling to handle situations like when the location is invalid.
