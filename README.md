### Project Description

Bop It!

 

For our final project, we plan to use our board to recreate the famous game Bop It. The game consists of multiple peripheral inputs and a prompt that tells the player which input to use. Players score points by using the input corresponding to what the prompt tells them to do within a certain amount of time, and lose the game when they either use the wrong input or don’t respond in the allotted time. Inputs include pressing a button, shaking the device, and twisting a knob.

 

There will also be a 2-player mode that will include either passing off the device, or transferring control to a separate device. As well as a hard mode, that will limit helpful visual/audio cues when communicating the prompt to the player.
### Technical Approach

The board already includes two of the three inputs necessary for the game: a button and an accelerometer (for shaking the device). To implement a twisting knob, we will connect a potentiometer to the board. 

 

As for the game itself, we will need to implement timers and randomizers, as well as use our knowledge of GPIOs to incorporate the potentiometer. 

 

Furthermore, we will incorporate Pygame to create a more visual element to the game. We will still utilize the digital numerical display on the boards as well as the LEDs, but not to the degree of Pygame GUIs. However, in the case where hard mode is enabled, the only cues will come from the board’s LEDs.

## Feedback.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/ahk86-amf349" then the GitHub page is at "https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/ahk86-amf349" You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
