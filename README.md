### Project Description

Metronome. We will visualize tempos using the blinking LEDs. We can add complexity to this by leveraging the two LEDs to form two beats in parallel and generate polyrhythms. We can also vary the beat in time, for example having a half note and a rest after a triplet. This can allow musicians to help see the frequency at which they should hit their notes.
### Technical Approach

We only need the basic LEDs and the timer peripheral modules for the board to enable parallelism with respect to polyrhythms.
