### Project Description

We're planning on creating a Morse Lock, which is creating a four digit password using morse code. We're breaking it into two sections, setting the passcode, and entering the passcode. The user should be able to use the buttons to insert a four digit number via morse code and save it. Afterwards, they can use the buttons to unlock it, the LEDs will tell them if they are right or wrong. Once unlocked, the user has the option to reset the password or lock it again.
### Technical Approach

We're planning on using the buttons (SW1, SW3) to input the morse code, and the touch slider for setting a new passcode or clearing input based on the number of fingers on the touch slider. We're also using the LCD display to display the morse code digit. 

We're planning on doing all of this in C and GitHub, and Interrupts for dealing with user input

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/ac2262-ewl62-ss2956 then the GitHub page is at https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/ac2262-ewl62-ss2956 . You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
