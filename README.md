### Project Description

Create a game of paper football where one player shoots a folded paper into a goal. When they have successfully shot the football into the goal, the game counter will increment.
### Technical Approach

We have chosen to use TCRT5000 IR sensors to be placed on each side of a 3D-printed football goal. This sensor has an onboard potentiometer that we will adjust so that when the ball goes through the goal, the onboard LED will light up and the digital pin will output a digital high. This digital high will translate to the 7-segment display on the FRDM-KL46Z_UM to increment the score counter and as a countdown during which the player must make a goal.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/kmm477-rsb359-zmc6 then the GitHub page is at https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/kmm477-rsb359-zmc6 . You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
