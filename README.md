### Project Description

Tamagotchi was an electronic toy featuring a virtual pet that took the world by storm in the late 1990s. Players cared and fed for their virtual pets, growing them and making them lively and happy, and if neglected, the pet would grow sad and could even die. Tamagotchi serves as the inspiration for our final project. The FRDM-KL46Z’s processing and memory will help store and process data about a virtual pet. A player would be able to interact with their pet using the board, playing with their pet or feeding it through button presses, capacitive touch, and accelerometer controls on the board. The pet could be happy, sad, healthy or unhealthy, and should respond favorably to user interactions and negatively to neglect in realtime. The user would be able to view their pet and information about their pet through a GUI.
### Technical Approach

For the base game, we are planning to use pygame, an open source game engine that uses python source code. Other than having a connection between the games display and the FRDM-KL46Z, there are no other hardware components needed for this implementation. For controlling the Tamagotchi sprite, we plan on trying to use the buttons, touch screen, and the accelerometer in some meaningful way; such as using the accelerometer to move the sprite to a piece of food on the screen, or using the touch screen to interact with the sprite or with the sprites statistics. There will be many states that the sprite could be in, for example, it could be in a playing state, eating state, sleeping state, etc. For all these states, we will most likely use an FSM to monitor all of the state transitions and the inputs or events that could trigger a state transition. One example of a possible event that would trigger a state change would be a timer interrupt. We could use the PIT timer to time events such as when the sprite will become hungry or when it will be sleeping. Another timer channel could be used to keep track of the time since the sprite was last fed, and if that time crosses a threshold we set, it could enter a state where the sprite “dies”, and a tombstone is shown.

## Feedback.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/dmr284-hkt26-jcp327" then the GitHub page is at "https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/dmr284-hkt26-jcp327" You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
