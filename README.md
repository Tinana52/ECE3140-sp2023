### Project Description

We will send commands from the FRDM board to an Arduino board using UART communication. The robot will be able to go forwards, backwards, and turn left and right.
### Technical Approach

The goal of our project is to control the locomotion of a dual-motor robot using the FRDM board. We will implement a UART serial communication protocol to communicate between the FRDM board and an Arduino Mega. The FRDM board will send commands to the Mega. Depending on the received commands, the Mega will output PWM values to drive the motors on the robot.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/ch682-kz273-tg382 then the GitHub page is at https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/ch682-kz273-tg382 . You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
