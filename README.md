### Project Description

We would like to design a reaction time game with two players to see who can win in a competition of speed. We want to use the board to facilitate the game, utilizing the buttons to track the players' reactions and the LCD screen to display results.
### Technical Approach

We plan to use general-purpose input-output (GPIO) as we want to use multiple buttons on the board. We also are planning to override interrupts because when a player hits a button, we need to handle the result of the pressed button, ie if player A or B wins.
