### Project Description

We are planning on building a drone using the board. Our current plan is to find/use software to emulate a flight controller using ibus communication protocol. Johnny has many drone parts such as motors, esc, transmitter/receiver, etc. Both team members are also on Cornell Aerial Robotics Club, so we do have experience with drones. However, if additional parts are needed, we all agreed to split the costs. A 3D printer will be used to print the frame. We do understand the difficulty of this project, and we have decided that if a drone is too hard, we will plan on creating a RC car (or something that does not fly). In the next couple of days, we intend to explore the feasibility of our drone project and decide for certain if this is the path we want to take. 
### Technical Approach

Many drone flight controllers communicate with external hardware via the ibus communication protocol. We plan on writing code or potentially finding a code library online that will allow our board to emulate a flight controller. We will then use a lipo battery, electronic speed controls, motors, a transmitter and a receiver to build our quadcopter. We must then also learn how to control the 4 escs and the receiver with the GPIO pins on the board. If this proves to be too difficult, we will shift to an RC car which would be less challenging.
