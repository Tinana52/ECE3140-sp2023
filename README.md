### Project Description

We are going to build a tetris-like game where blocks fall and a row is completed when all blocks in that row are filled. There will be multiple different shapes that fall. Shapes can be rotated and moved around on the screen by spinning the board and pressing the buttons on the board. There will be one level to this game.Â 
### Technical Approach

We intend to use the board as a game controller as the board already has buttons and an accelerometer. The game we implement will be something along the lines of Tetris. Game will be built in python, and we will program the board in C and assembly to interact with the python script on a laptop.
