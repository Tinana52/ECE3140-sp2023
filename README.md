## Welcome team! Please edit me.

### You can use the master branch for you code.

### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch.
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows
"https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/YOUR_TEAM" then the GitHub page is at "https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/YOUR_TEAM"
You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.

NOTE: Niether of these links should work wince there is no team named "YOUR_TEAM".
