### Project Description

We would be making a human-computer interface glove, which is able to read the gesture of the person’s glove who is wearing it, specifically, how much each finger is bending, or the rotation of the hand using short flex sensors. Such information would be sent to the computer, and we would develop software to make interesting applications. For example, we might create a digital hand replica in some game engine, so this digital hand could reflect the gesture of the physical hand in real-time. 
### Technical Approach

Our peripherals include an Adafruit short flex sensors, gloves, 3D printer, and FRDM-KL46Z. We would be using a short flex sensor for each finger, such sensor’s resistance will change depending on its bending (25K if unbent). We will be using a 100K pull-down resistor to convert this information to voltage, thus be able to be received by the analog pin. We will use a gyro sensor to detect the rotation of the hand. Additionally, we can look at serial data to detect the amount of squeezing/bending occurring. We will 3D-print a glove to hold those sensors and the board. Then, we will connect the board with our computer using UART, and now the computer has access to the gesture information, then the software we gonna develop will reflect the gesture on the digital hand model. According to the data sheet, the flex sensors only use approximately 1mA of current, so we will most likely hook up the board’s output pins to a breadboard and attach the flex sensors to the breadboard. For creating the digital hand replica, we may use a game engine such as Unity and transfer serial data regarding voltage, conductance, FSR resistance, or force to enable digital movements.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/aoa34-wty5-yc938 then the GitHub page is at https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/aoa34-wty5-yc938 . You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
