### Project Description

We plan to make a accelerometer-based USB mouse using the board's USB interface. If the user either moves the board laterally or tilts the board, it will cause the mouse pointer on the computer to move in accordance. We will also implement a feature where if the user either presses a button or physically lifts the board, the mouse will stop moving, in order to allow the user to "lift" the mouse and readjust its position without moving the cursor.
### Technical Approach

We intend to use the accelerometer and possibly the magnetometer to detect the movement of the board. We will use the USB connection on the board as a HID to move the mouse.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/jwb373-wdb65 then the GitHub page is at https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/jwb373-wdb65 . You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
