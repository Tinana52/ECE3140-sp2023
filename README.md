### Project Description

We plan to use the on-board accelerometer to simulate user navigation in a game.  Moving the board left to right simulates steering - we still have not decided the theme of the game but were gearing more toward collision avoidance (potentially asteroids or driving a car through obstacles).  
### Technical Approach

We plan to use pygame to build the user-interface.  We will likely process all the data in a C file and then send that to the python game via UART communication.

## Welcome team! Please edit me.
### You can use the 'main' branch for you code.
### The GitHub web-page should be in the 'gh-pages' branch
You can access the page adding a "pages" prefix to the url for the git repo e.g. if your browser currently shows https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/cak248-klt45" then the GitHub page is at "https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/ece3140-sp22/cak248-klt45" You can edit the source in the gh-pages branch or use the "automatic page generator" acessible via settings->options in the GitHub Pages Section toward the bottom. We recommend the latter approach since it is quick and easy. We made an initial wepage that you can edit and a description of the headings we expect to see.
